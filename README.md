Chiplet Design Exchange (CDX) Workstream of ODSA focuses on electrical, mechanical, and thermal design exchange standards related to chiplets and integration in the context of multi chiplet modules, 2.5D and 3D Integrated Circuits (IC). This initial release of Chiplet Data Exchange in XML Format (CDXML) for but not limited to the following chiplets purposes:
* Data exchange between different formats
* Design
* Integration
* Assembly rules

This format is based on the zGlue Chiplets Info Exchange Format (ZEF) released with open-source copyright in 2019. As requested by the authors of ZEF, we acknowledge zGlue Inc for releasing ZEF in the open-source domain. All of the authors of ZEF have agreed to participate in developing this CDXML to replace the obsolete ZEF.

CDX is promoting this chiplet model for wider usage through open initiatives. CDXML sets a foundation for the standard machine-readable description of Chiplets, in order to help automate design and business processes across companies when it comes to chiplet-based business ecosystems. The spirit of this disclosure is to encourage openness in an otherwise closed-source industry of chip design. CDX and OCP are releasing this license based on creative commons open source license.
